# ispdfgen
Repository with templates for generating PDF's in iSyfo domain. 

## Technologies & Tools

* Docker
* Gradle
* Kotlin
* Ktor
#### Creating a docker image
Creating a docker image: `docker build -t ispdfgen .`

## Getting started
When running the application you can use the env var `DISABLE_PDF_GET` to enable GET requests at
`/api/v1/genpdf/<application>/<template>` which looks for test data at `data/<application>/<template>.json` and outputs
a PDF to your browser. Additionally, the template folder will be fetched on every request, and reflect any changes made
since the last GET, making this ideal for developing new templates for your application.

### Notes on developing templates on Windows
It is a known issue that pdfgen's output documents look different depending on whether the template
has `\r\n` or `\n` as line endings. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to configure Git to not convert newlines, as well as ensure that your editor ends its lines with LF (`\n`) and not CRLF (`\r\n`), as the former will accurately show what your
templates will look like in production.
